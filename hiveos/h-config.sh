# levykrak has provided hiveos support for the old mining software xengpuminer (https://github.com/levykrak/xengpuminer),
# and has provided a hiveos environment that enabled us to offer hiveos support for the new miner xenblocksMiner, assisting in bug fixes.
# The default address below is used to express gratitude for these contributions to the ecosystem.

DEFAULT_DEVFEE_PERMILLAGE=21 # 2.1% for total devfee
# In the context of hiveos support, a 2% developer fee is quite standard and is intended to fuel further feature support and development. 
# This equates to a default devfee of 2.1% (21 per mille) for the total development fee.
# If you believe this developer fee is too high, we have provided an option for you to override it. 
# To do so, enter {"devfee_permillage": "your_desired_value"} in the 'extra config arguments' section of your flight sheet, 
# where 'your_desired_value' is a number between 0 and 1000, according to your preference.
# Standard miner pick up all your GPUs. There is option to choose which gpu_id should be used. {"device_id":"0,4,7"}
